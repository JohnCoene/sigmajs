library(sigmajs)
```

## Basics

Below are the basics of the package.

1. All graphs *must* be initialised with the `sigmajs()` function.
2. All the functions of the package start with `sg_`.
3. All proxies end in `_p`.
4. Functions are pipe-friendly (`%>%`).

## Variables

The variable names must follow [sigma.js convention](https://github.com/jacomyal/sigma.js/wiki).

Nodes must *ideally* include, at least:

* `id` unique id of node, note that this does not have to be numerical
* `size` size of node
* `color` color of node

These are passed to `sg_nodes`. Note that sigma.js requires passing `x` and `y`, if omitted the function will randomly assign x and y positions.

Edges *must* include, at least:

* `id` unique id of edge
* `source` source of edge
* `target` target of edge

`source` and `target` refer to the nodes `id`

Remember to always follow the naming convention.

## Convenience functions

The package comes with two convenience functions to generate data, mainly to be used for testing.

* `sg_make_nodes` to generate nodes, you can specify the number of nodes you want.
* `sg_make_edges` to generate edges based on the nodes, you can specify the number of edges you want.

## Settings

Above I state that you must *ideally* pass `size` and `color` to the nodes. I say "ideally" because, you actually can omit `color` *if* you then pass default color using `sg_settings`.

There a lot of settings to pass, see the [official wiki](https://github.com/jacomyal/sigma.js/wiki/Settings) for a list of all settings.

## Your first graphs

```{r, eval = TRUE}
# generate data using convenience functions
nodes <- sg_make_nodes()
edges <- sg_make_edges(nodes)

sigmajs() %>%
  sg_nodes(nodes, id, size, color) %>%
  sg_edges(edges, id, source, target)
```

Or as stated in the Settings section, you can omit `size` and `color` but you then must pass defaults using `sg_settings`.

```{r}
sigmajs() %>%
  sg_nodes(nodes, id, size) %>%
  sg_edges(edges, id, source, target) %>%
  sg_settings(defaultNodeColor = "#c9423f") # pass default color
```
