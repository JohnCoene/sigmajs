## Crosstalk

<span class="text-warning"><i class="fa fa-warning"></i> still in development.</span>

Since `v0.1.0` the package is `crosstalk` integrated.

Because graphs consist of two data.frames (nodes and edges), [crosstalk](https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/) is restricted to one of them, nodes. In essence, not much changes, you use the `SharedData` built with `crosstalk` like you would normally use the `nodes` data frame. 

```{r}
library(DT)
library(sigmajs)
library(crosstalk)

nodes <- sg_make_nodes(20)
edges <- sg_make_edges(nodes)

# Wrap data frame in SharedData
sd <- SharedData$new(nodes)

# Use SharedData like a dataframe with Crosstalk-enabled widgets
bscols(
  sigmajs() %>% 
    sg_nodes(sd, id, color, size) %>% 
    sg_edges(edges, id, source, target) %>% 
    sg_layout(),
  datatable(sd, extensions = "Scroller", style = "bootstrap", class = "compact", width = "100%",
    selection = "single")
)
```
